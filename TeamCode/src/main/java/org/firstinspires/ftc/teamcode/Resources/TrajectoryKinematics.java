/**
 * TrajectoryKinematics

 * Utility class used to estimate launcher ramp angle and flywheel speed needed to score
 * into the goal from a measured distance. This class uses simple regression functions
 * (tuned from empirical testing) to convert a distance in inches to:
 * - an initial ramp angle in degrees
 * - a flywheel speed (magnitude) in degrees per second

 * Important notes and assumptions:
 * - All distances are in inches unless otherwise noted.
 * - Angles are in degrees.
 * - Flywheel "magnitude" is treated as degrees per second (an angular velocity command
 *   for the flywheel motor controller).
 * - The regression functions here are based on limited prototype testing. They are
 *   intended as simple mapping functions and should be re-tuned with larger datasets
 *   for production use.
 * - This class does not perform physical ballistic calculations. Instead it returns
 *   values from tuned regression polynomials (see {@link #angleRegression} and
 *   {@link #magnitudeRegression}).
 *
 * Thread-safety: This class is not synchronized. If accessed concurrently from multiple
 * threads (for example multiple opmodes), callers should ensure external synchronization
 * or use separate instances.
